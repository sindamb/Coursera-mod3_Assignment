              the office of principal of college of Education. I also tried to
              apply for a job. Look at the attached application letter. Dear

              in this disruptive, nonprofit social enterprise. In fact, I am
              finishing the last academic year (2019-2023) to get an award of
              Bachelor degree of Science with honours in Mathematics and Physics
              with Education, awarded by the University of Rwanda. I am sending
              my application because my aability to work in and as a team,

              pressure and meet deadlines, inter-personal communication skills
              that allow me to perform at the best on this position. I would
              like to work for your big enterprise with a lot of positive
              impacts to whom it serves and with many big awards like 2018 Klaus
              J. Jacobs Prize and a 2015 WISE Award. I am a strong candidate to
